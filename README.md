An R package containing a single Bayesian ordered categorical GLM. This package accompanies a [Shiny app](https://willwolf.shinyapps.io/ordered-categorical-a-b-test/) that A/B tests ordered, 1 to 5 feedback scores using this model. Because the model is written in [RStan](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan), which itself requires a C++ build step, creating an R package proved the easiest way to deploy it to a [Shinyapps](http://www.shinyapps.io/) server.
